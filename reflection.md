Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
For Cafe, I chose to overload the restock method and create two more restock methods were I didn't have to restock the entire inventory just certain items when they rain out. It is still possible to restock everything but now you can restock sugar separately along with cups and coffee grounds. 
For House, I updated the contructor so that there is one basic constructor method that only takes in parameters that have to do with the parent class. I also created another move in method where you can move in two people at a time instead of just one. 
For Library, I did a similar thing to house where I made another method for addTitle and checkOut so you can check out multiple books and add mutliple titles to the collection at once which saves time and memory. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I wasn't able to show my methods in the campus map class but I am going to go to office hours and see what I can do to fix it.
